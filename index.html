            <h2 id="abt_me">About Me</h2>
            <p id="bio">My name is Diego A. Ramos. I go to The Barrie School and am in my Senior Year of High School. 
            I have been studying computer science as a means of trying to find a future career. I started coding in Middle School and my Freshman Year in High School 
            and have now enrolled myself into the All Star Code Summer Intensive to begin my process of realizing my want to presue a career in computer science.
            I enjoy solving puzzles, answering problems, and math; It is my favorite subject. I also enjoying doing other things besides coding in my free time such as 
            playing and watching soccer matches, spending time with my family, working out, and playing video games with my friends on my free time. I am in the start of the college 
            application process and plan on studying computer science and am in the midst of finding my perfect school. I have great aspirations and expectations of myself 
            and plan on being the best version of me!</p>

            <p id="ach_info">I go to a Private School called The Barrie School. I have a all time 3.4 Grade Point Average and a 3.8 GPA for this school year. I play on the boys soccer
                 team and am a leader on the defensive side of the team. On my free time I've done personal projects such as coming up and designing a Software As A Service (S.A.A.S) 
                 Buisseness along with making my own website for it and plan on persuing this idea into a full blown LLC. At All Star Code I have also done many projects such as making a small 
                 maze game with two peers where we you are a small box that trails a line and you have to avoid obstacles and make it to the finish line on 4 different levels. Everytime you complete
                  a maze you get 100 points but every time you hit an obstacle you lose 10. Finish the game with over 350 points and you win. I've done a lot of community serivce with my Dad where we set up 
                fund raisers for small soccer teams in El Salvador. In these events we make food, buy drinks, invite a ton of people to buy and contribute to our cause. With the money we accumelate, 
                we go to sports stores to buy cleats, balls, jerseys, cones, and other materials to give to the young players an oppurtunity to persue a career. We also make trips to
                El Salvador to deliever the materials and equipment we buy and give the left over money to the teams in need.</p>
